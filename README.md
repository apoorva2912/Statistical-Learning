Review Paper on RNN


Meta-Learning or the term learning to learn is often talked about and used to describe the use of learning framework to learn on data of learning algorithm to achieve better results. In this report it is used in different forms for various different applications. Recurrent Neural Networks is a subclass of neural networks. In this report we see that they are highly versatile int their application and their inherent ability to store previous information is useful for variety of different application. We use Recurrent Neural Networks on black box optimization and also as an optimization algorithm for specific learning framework. Result shows us that it performs and generalizes quite well in both the scenarios.
